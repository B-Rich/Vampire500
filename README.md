Vampire500
==========

Experimental Core for the Vampire 500 Amiga accelerator project.

This repository contains an experimental codebase for the Vampire 500 prototype board which Majsta sent
me some months ago.  That codebase isn't currently in a working state, but contains a lot of code that
might be useful for the Vampire 600 project.
